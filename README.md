The program will check the number of lines in a user specified text file against the user specified amount.
The program will then automatically update or have the user manually update the number of lines in the file.

  - Program works
  - moved stuff out of main
  - created multiple functions
  - update file automatically without user's consent
  - template for a file check added but not implemented
  - No changes to text files
